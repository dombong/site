I enjoy working with distributed systems and learning about different programming languages designs and implementations.  I like types and PL components that encourages safe programming and promote fearless concurrency.  

I got my Bachelor of Science with Honours in Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences focusing in Computer Science at Yale-NUS College.  My capstone: *Borrowing without Sorrowing: Implementing Extract Method Refactoring for Rust* under the supervision of [Prof. Ilya Sergey](https://ilyasergey.net/) and with the help of the team at [VERSE lab](https://verse-lab.github.io/) won the Yale-NUS College's **Outstanding Capstone Prize 2023**.  Feel free to have a read [here](https://fastmail-resource.sewenthy.dev/public/academics/bsc_capstone_borrowing_without_sorrowing.pdf).
