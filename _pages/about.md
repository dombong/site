I am a final year student pursuing my Bachelor of Science with Honours in Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences focusing in Computer Science at Yale-NUS College.  I am currently doing my capstone implementing the extract method refactoring for Rust by contributing to IntelliJ's plugin under the supervision of [Prof. Ilya Sergey](https://ilyasergey.net/) with the help of the team at [VERSE lab](https://verse-lab.github.io/).  

I enjoy working with concurrent systems and learning about different programming languages designs and implementations.  I am attending [PLMW@SPLASH 2022](https://2022.splashcon.org/track/splash-2022-PLMW) to learn more.  

I am currently interning at [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) as a backend intern where I am excited about using OCaml in real-life and applying it to a large distributed system setting.
