After my graduation in 2023, one of the biggest part I miss about Yale-NUS is the green campus that everywhere I look there's always some small piece of gardens.  My suitemates are even more into plants so when I walk into their rooms, there are always some potted plants with even some long green leafy vines growing from the top of his bookcase.  I was never a fan of having dirt spills from the plants onto my floor and more importantly I never felt responsible enough to take care of them so I never had any while I was at school.  

Since I moved out I have been playing a lot with home automations using [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) using the [Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA)](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/).  I realized that while I still might forget to water my plants, I can try to get my garden to water itself--and I can make cool graphs with all my sensors data.  

# Picking the plants
I have been trying to have a more vegetarian diet so I wanted to priorities my favorites such as [eggplants (brinjal)](https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/edible-plants/brinjal/), [tomatoes](https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/edible-plants/tomato/) and [winged beans](https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/edible-plants/winged-bean/).  After some quick googling, I found that the Singapore government encourages all these gardening efforts and even have amazing resources on how to get them growing.  

Though as I read through I realized I forgot about one important thing: bees.  Aside from winged beans most of the veggies I like need pollination and so needs some kind of pollinators.  As I live on 20th floors, I wasn't sure if they would come all the way up.  I needed something to check first so I decided to start small: [butterfly peas](https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/edible-plants/butterfly-pea/).  These are even [considered weeds](https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/edible-plants/butterfly-pea/) in some cases because they grow so easily so I'm definitely making my life easier and they have the added benefit of being a bees attractor.  

# Getting supplies and starting the seedlings
After consulting more internet resources, I found out I needed the following:  
* some loamy soils\*  
* pots of at least 20cm deep\*  
* trellis (for the vines to climb)  
* seedlings tray  
* seeds  

\*as adviced by [NParks](https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/edible-plants/butterfly-pea/).  

I got the seedling tray that have some holes in the bottom since I'm completely new at this so I might overwater the seedlings and I also the lid to protect it while it's sitting on my balcony.  

I got the soil and seed, from a local seller for a combined of ~SGD5 and the rest I got off of AliExpress which totals to ~SGD10.  

I only just started to sow the seeds yesterday and we will see the result soon!
